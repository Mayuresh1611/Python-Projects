00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,958
Hurry up, dammit!

279
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,416
[MIKASA] I'm trying!

280
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,916
It's them. You've got
to get out of here!

281
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,666
Eren! Just take
Mikasa and run! Now!

282
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,625
I want to, more than anything!

283
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,250
[EREN] But first I
need you on your feet!

284
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:22,000
Sweetie, listen to me.
My legs have been crushed.

285
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,791
Even if you could get me
out of here, I can't run.

286
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:26,833
There's no time.

287
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,458
Whatever! I can carry you!

288
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,958
Will you just shut up and listen
to me for once in your life?

289
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,791
[CARLA] One thing I'm asking
you! One thing!

290
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,416
[CARLA] Mikasa, make him!

291
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,583
[MIKASA] I can't.

292
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,791
You want all
three of us to die?

293
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,041
Hannes!

294
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,250
Take the children and
get them out of here!

295
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,833
Come on, Carla; that's
not our only option.

296
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,416
Hey, I'm a trained soldier.

297
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,375
My skill set is killin'
Titans and saving lives!

298
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,500
[CARLA] No, wait!
Don't do this! Please!

299
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,208
[thinking] Nothing fancy.
Just take it down.

300
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,333
Get all three of
'em out of harm's way.

301
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,166
Make good on the debt you owe!

303
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:29,541
[EREN] No! What are you doing?
Put me down, you bastard!

304
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:31,125
Thank you, Hannes.

305
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,958
[EREN] Wait! No!

306
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,875
[EREN] We can't
just leave her! Mom!

307
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,375
I love you! You hear me?
